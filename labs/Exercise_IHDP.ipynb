        "This is an opportunity for everyone to put into practice everything we have learnt so far. The data for this exercise comes from Infant Health Development Program study and was modified specifically for causal inference estimation purposes. More precisely, this dataset was formally introduced by [Hill (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2010.08162). It is a commonly used semi-simulated dataset in the CI community that combines pre-treatment covariates (X) and treatment assignments (T) from a real study, and simulated outcomes (Y). Because all outcomes are generated (both $y_1$ and $y_0$), we can measure individual as well as average treatment effect errors. For training purposes, only one of the outcomes is available to the estimator. The other is hidden and used only for evaluation purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The experiment where the covariates come from measured various aspects of premature infants and their mothers, and how receiving specialised childcare affected the cognitive test score of the infants later on. The treatment groups are made imbalanced by removing a subset of the treated individuals. The variables are a mixture of contonuous and binary features. Treatment is binary. The outcome Y is continuous. Overall, we have 25 background features X. The data consists of 747 samples (139 treated, 608 control)."
