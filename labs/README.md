# Labs - Part 1 and 2

In this practical session, we will focus on two classic ML tasks, regression and classification, in order to estimate effects of interventions. We start with a guided example, running and discussing each line of code step-by-step. This part will showcase how the concepts presented in slides can be realised in code. Further exercises provide an opportunity to work more independently and put into practice everything we have learnt so far. All incorporated datasets are available under [data](data) folder.
