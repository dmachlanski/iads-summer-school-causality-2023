Todd (2005)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/econom/v125y2005i1-2p305-353.html), is a combination of the experiment done by [LaLonde (1986)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1806062) as part of the National Supported Work Program (NSWP) and observational data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) [(Dehejia and Wahba 2002)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v84y2002i1p151-161.html).
